        <p>I want to be an astronomer and a computer engineer,I am in grade5.I have made this website, and i am actually a kid, and learned coding from whitehat junior. In this website there will be tests and books and many things, also you can contact me through the mobile number and my email id i have provided in the contact section, but that is not the real email-id, or if i give the email-id, anybody can hack me!.Well i can say that i "love" the universe, i also like computer engineering, but i mostly like universe.Well, i am inspired by astronomer phil plait and albert einstien, if you want to know more about them, you can go to the inspiration section.Well you may see the heading "work", but i have not actually done any work, you know i am a kid, how can i do work!, i have just written some knowledge about the universe, that i know. In the videos section i have provided four videos about the universe. In the books section i have provided some books that you can buy about the universe. In the tests section i have provided some tests that you with tests that you can practise to make yourself better at understanding the universe. Well, if you like my website, you can comment me through through input boxes in the contact section, i think you will like my website!. In the first part of the website which has the nabigation buttons, you may see computer engineering option, if you click on that it will open my one more computer engineering website, in which there are many things about codings. Have a nice day!.

        <p>The earliest cosmological models of the universe were developed by ancient Greek and Indian philosophers and were geocentric, placing Earth at the center.[11][12] Over the centuries, more precise astronomical observations led Nicolaus Copernicus to develop the heliocentric model with the Sun at the center of the Solar System. In developing the law of universal gravitation, Isaac Newton built upon Copernicus's work as well as Johannes Kepler's laws of planetary motion and observations by Tycho Brahe.Further observational improvements led to the realization that the Sun is one of hundreds of billions of stars in the Milky Way, which is one of at least two trillion galaxies in the universe. Many of the stars in our galaxy have planets. At the largest scale, galaxies are distributed uniformly and the same in all directions, meaning that the universe has neither an edge nor a center. At smaller scales, galaxies are distributed in clusters and superclusters which form immense filaments and voids in space, creating a vast foam-like structure.[13] Discoveries in the early 20th century have suggested that the universe had a beginning and that space has been expanding, since then,[14] and is currently still expanding at an increasing rate.[15]According to the Big Bang theory, the energy and matter initially present have become less dense as the universe expanded. After an initial accelerated expansion called the inflationary epoch at around 10−32 seconds, and the separation of the four known fundamental forces, the universe gradually cooled and continued to expand, allowing the first subatomic particles and simple atoms to form. Dark matter gradually gathered, forming a foam-like structure of filaments and voids under the influence of gravity. Giant clouds of hydrogen and helium were gradually drawn to the places where dark matter was most dense, forming the first galaxies, stars, and everything else seen today.From studying the movement of galaxies, it has been discovered that the universe contains much more matter than is accounted for by visible objects; stars, galaxies, nebulas and interstellar gas. This unseen matter is known as dark matter[16] (dark means that there is a wide range of strong indirect evidence that it exists, but we have not yet detected it directly). The ΛCDM model is the most widely accepted model of our universe. It suggests that about 69.2%±1.2% [2015] of the mass and energy in the universe is a cosmological constant (or, in extensions to ΛCDM, other forms of dark energy, such as a scalar field) which is responsible for the current expansion of space, and about 25.8%±1.1% [2015] is dark matter.[17] Ordinary ('baryonic') matter is therefore only 4.84%±0.1% [2015] of the physical universe.[17] Stars, planets, and visible gas clouds only form about 6% of the ordinary matter.[18]There are many competing hypotheses about the ultimate fate of the universe and about what, if anything, preceded the Big Bang, while other physicists and philosophers refuse to speculate, doubting that information about prior states will ever be accessible. Some physicists have suggested various multiverse hypotheses, in which our universe might be one among many universes that likewise exist.[3][19][20]</p>
